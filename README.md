# APhotoEverydayDB
“APhotoEveryday” (APE) dataset contains the faces (images or videos) of 98 individuals with large appearance variations across time.
The APE dataset was acquired by the University of Cagliari and consists of facial images extracted from YouTube Daily Photo Projects.
Faces were captured in the frontal pose and most of these have a controlled expression. The images of each user are labelled with a number that indicates the temporal progression of the sequence.
The APE dataset images are characterized by many temporal variations of the facial appearance thanks to the Daily Photo Project\footnote{See for example \url{https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBPYDIzEbYk}}.
The number of images per user varies between 92 and 3592 and the acquisition time varies between less than one year and seventeen years.
